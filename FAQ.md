  - Is there literature you recommend for increasing math & statistics knowledge (if possible divided into levels from beginner to expert)?
  - Will the project be in a group or alone?
  - Are there some basic requirements a project should have?
  - Will you give a list of projects that we can choose from if we can't think of one on our own?
  - When is the written report due and how many pages should that be?
