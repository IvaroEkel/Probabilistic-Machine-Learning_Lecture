## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students should:

- Understand the probabilistic foundations of machine learning.
  
- Distinguish between frequentist and Bayesian inference methods.
  
- Implement and analyze a variety of Machine Learning tasks, using models/methods such as:
      - Generalized Additive/Linear Models (GAMs/GLMs)
      - Gaussian Mixture Models
      - Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
