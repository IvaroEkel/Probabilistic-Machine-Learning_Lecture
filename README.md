## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students should:

- Understand the probabilistic foundations of machine learning.
  
- Distinguish between frequentist and Bayesian inference methods.
  
- Implement and analyze regression models (linear and nonlinear).
  
- Apply probabilistic graphical models, including inference algorithms.
  
- Understand variational methods and apply them in deep learning contexts.
  
- Train probabilistic deep neural networks using modern optimization techniques.
