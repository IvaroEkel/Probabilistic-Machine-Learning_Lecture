# Probabilistic-Machine-Learning_Lecture
Notes and colab notebooks for the course on Probabilistic Machine Learning at the University of Leipzig. Part of the Master's degree on Data Science.

# Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students should:

    Understand the probabilistic foundations of machine learning.

    Distinguish between frequentist and Bayesian inference methods.

    Implement and analyze regression models (linear and nonlinear).

    Apply probabilistic graphical models, including inference algorithms.

    Understand variational methods and apply them in deep learning contexts.

    Train probabilistic deep neural networks using modern optimization techniques.
