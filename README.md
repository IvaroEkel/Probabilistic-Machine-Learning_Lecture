# Probabilistic-Machine-Learning_Lecture
Notes and colab notebooks for the course on Probabilistic Machine Learning at the University of Leipzig. Part of the Master's degree on Data Science.

# Lecture notes [here]() (to be uploaded soon, and progressively updated).

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students should:

- Understand the probabilistic foundations of machine learning.
  
- Distinguish between frequentist and Bayesian inference methods.
  
- Implement and analyze regression models (linear and nonlinear).
  
- Apply probabilistic graphical models, including inference algorithms.
  
- Understand variational methods and apply them in deep learning contexts.
  
- Train probabilistic deep neural networks using modern optimization techniques.

# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions:

  - Is there literature you recommend for increasing math & statistics knowledge (if possible divided into levels from beginner to expert)? 
  - Will the project be in a group or alone? 
  - Are there some basic requirements a project should have? 
  - Will you give a list of projects that we can choose from if we can't think of one on our own? 
  - When is the written report due and how many pages should that be?
